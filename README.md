# Shitty Log Sherlock
Have you found yourself in a situation where you have difficult to work with logger libraries intervening and vomiting everything on the screen leaving you with mountains logs to sift through?

## DIRTY TODO
- hidden `len(s) - 2` looks awkward
- `faint` colouring not coming through in `gocui`
- look at weird log entry spacing, can't explain why it works
